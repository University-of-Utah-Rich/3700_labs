\section{Introduction}
This first lab will walk you through the steps of installing the software you will use throughout this course and introduce you to the style used in subsequent lab manuals.
\section{Style Guide}
The lab manuals in this course use a variety of visual cues to help students navigate the complexities of digital design more easily. These queues are explained below.
\subsection{Call-outs}
\textbf{Critical information} required to successfully complete the lab will appear as shown:
\begin{important}[frametitle={Critical Info}]
Critical information is called out using a red box.
\end{important}
\textbf{Useful information} is called out in a blue box as shown:
\begin{extra}[frametitle={Useful Information}]
    Useful but not critical information is called out using a blue box.
\end{extra}
\textbf{Questions} will prompt you to think critically about the material and answers to them may be required in your final report. Check with your professor to determine the expectation.

\begin{question}[Questions are yellow]
Questions are called out in a yellow box.
\end{question}
\subsection{Keywords and code}
\textbf{Keywords} will always be typeset in bold. This will help you recognize important terms quickly. \textbf{Code blocks} are formatted as shown:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Verilog]
    assign y = (a & b) | (~a & c);
\end{lstlisting}
simple inline code or verilog terms are formatted in truetype bold. For example: Name the \code{module} you just created \textbf{example.v}.
